# Example Game Engine

This project is an example of a game engine written in C++, recording my learning progress of game development.

Plan:

* âœ” Follow [Ozzadar's game engine development Series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLKH0QdYnI6AnUW3V3xeUuIxr0nyE9j61h).
  * It's a good start point, because it's simple enough.
* Follow [Learn opengl](https://learnopengl-cn.github.io/)
  * I have done some tutorials, but need merge it into this project.
* Follow [Cherno's Hazel Game Engine Series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrATfBNZ98dC-V-N3m0Go4deliWHPFwT)
  * [github.com/TheCherno/Hazel](https://github.com/TheCherno/Hazel)
* Follow [Marcel Braghetto's A Simple Triangle](https://marcelbraghetto.github.io/a-simple-triangle/)
  * Get it running on browser with ecmascripten.
* Copy some game
  * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLqXFF8mlEU
  * Minecraft
* Read the book "Game Engine Architect"
  * Has many information, but it's hard to get start work with it.
